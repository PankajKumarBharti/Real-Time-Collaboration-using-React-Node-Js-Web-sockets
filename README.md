## Introduction to Real-Time Collaboration Project
In this project, we aim to develop a real-time collaboration platform using React.js, Node.js, and WebSockets. The platform will enable multiple users to work together simultaneously on shared content, such as text documents or code, in a synchronized and interactive environment.

## Purpose and Objective
The primary goal of this project is to create a collaborative tool that allows users to:

Edit documents in real time – Changes made by one user are instantly reflected for all other users.
Communicate effectively – Integrated chat or messaging to facilitate seamless discussions.
Provide real-time feedback – Allow users to comment or highlight specific sections collaboratively.
