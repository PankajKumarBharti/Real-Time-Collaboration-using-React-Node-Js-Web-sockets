## Introduction to Real-Time Collaboration Project
In this project, we aim to develop a real-time collaboration platform using React.js, Node.js, and WebSockets. The platform will enable multiple users to work together simultaneously on shared content, such as text documents or code, in a synchronized and interactive environment.
