## Introduction to Real-Time Collaboration Project
In this project, we aim to develop a real-time collaboration platform using React.js, Node.js, and WebSockets. The platform will enable multiple users to work together simultaneously on shared content, such as text documents or code, in a synchronized and interactive environment.

## Purpose and Objective
The primary goal of this project is to create a collaborative tool that allows users to:

## Edit documents in real time – Changes made by one user are instantly reflected for all other users.
## Communicate effectively – Integrated chat or messaging to facilitate seamless discussions.
## Provide real-time feedback – Allow users to comment or highlight specific sections collaboratively.

## Core Features

#### Real-Time Synchronization:
. Utilizes WebSockets for instant updates across all connected users.
. Handles conflict resolution to ensure data integrity.

#### User Authentication:
. Secure login and session handling using JWT or OAuth.

#### Scalable Backend:
. Built on Node.js with a robust and efficient architecture for managing concurrent users.

#### Dynamic Frontend:
. Developed using React.js, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience.

#### Collaboration Tools:
. Multi-user text editing or coding.
. Chat/messaging integration.
. User cursors to visualize co-editors' positions.
